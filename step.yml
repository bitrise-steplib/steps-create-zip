description: |-
Creates a ZIP from the given file/dir to the given destination.
  It stores symlinks as symlinks (it will not copy the file which the symlink is pointing to).

  ### Configuring the Step
  
  1. In the **Source directory** path, you have to provide the directory you want to compress.          
  2. In the **Target directory path** input, you can select where to output the compressed file. 
  
  ### Troubleshooting
 
 If the **Source directory** path does not exist, there will be an error.
 If the folder structure belonging to the destination does not exist, you will be notified with a warning in the log and then the step will create it.
 If a ZIP exists on the specified destination, the user will be notified with a warning in the log and then the previous file will be overwritten.
